# Issues-to-import-urllib.parse-in-PyCharm
I am trying to run a Python3 code that I learn in a course. However, I'm having issues to run it because the PyCharm is not recognizing url lib.parse. I have already install several packages hoping that I could fix this problem. I am a beginner programmer, so if you have any suggestion what it may be let me know. Thanks
